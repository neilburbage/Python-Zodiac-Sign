Ada Lovelace,1815-12-10,Sagittarius,"
Today is a very expansive day for you, Sagittarius. Your emotions can
lead you into favorable situations with others. The pace of the day may
seem a little slow, but this can be used to your advantage. Examine
every detail with care and try not to leave any piece of the equation
unaccounted for. You should enjoy a stable, caring mood that radiates
out and draws others toward you."
