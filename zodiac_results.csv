Ada Lovelace,1815-12-10,Sagittarius,"
Today could be filled with delays and mix-ups at the office,
Sagittarius. You'd be well advised to remain as patient as possible.
Take deep breaths and maintain your sense of humor. Most of what occurs
today is outside your control. You may as well go with the flow and see
where the day leads you. Make a point to relax with loved ones tonight."
